# Help:
Help is a project I'm starting that contains(or is going to contain) a wide range of tutorials, explanations and much more! Topics will range from using GitHub, [Repl.it](https://repl.it), Discord, and much more! 

### Why does this exist?
I created this to hopefully help new & aspiring developers find reliable & up to date information on how to use applications, and much more! But also so I can stop explaining how to use github and pretty much everything else once a week.

### Want to contribute?
Fork this repository, make your changes and publish a pull request which outlines what you're adding! Credit will be given at the bottom of all pages.
