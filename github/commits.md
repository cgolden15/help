# Commits, Pushes and pulls:

While starting to use github may seem daunting, I promise you its going to make sense soon enough. Lets start with the basics. 

## Commits on GitHub Web
Commits in Git are pretty simple, any time you add, remove, change or otherwise edit your code you have to "commit" the changes! When using github to edit files in your browser, you will see a box that looks like this:

<p align = "center"> <i>- Don't worry about branches yet, we'll get there! </i></p>
<br>

 A Simple way to keep your changes organized just in case you have to look back, or give others an easy way to understand your changes is by simply adding a description or alternate title. While that isnt necessairy, it also helps clean things up later on when using other features.
