# Commits, Pushes and pulls:

While starting to use github may seem daunting, I promise you its going to make sense soon enough. Lets start with the basics. 

## Commits on GitHub Web
Commits on GitHub are pretty simple, any time you add, remove, change or otherwise edit your code you have to "commit" the changes! When using github to edit files in your browser, you will see a box that looks like this:

<br>

 A Simple way to keep your changes organized just in case you have to look back, or give others an easy way to understand your changes is by simply adding a description or alternate title. While that isnt necessairy, it also helps clean things up later on when using other features.

## Commits on GitHub Desktop
Committing changes on github is slighly different than through the website. Using the github desktop client allows you to use your own editors, such as Visual Studio Code! I won't be going into much detail here, but if you need more help, check out the [GitHub Desktop](desktop.md) tutorial! 

While editing a file in a linked repository, you can see your changes appearing in the desktop client!

When you're ready to save your changes, theres a couple extra things we have to do before comitting our changes. Firstly, on the GitHub client window, make sure your current repository and branch are correct.

<p align = "center"> <i>- "Fetch origin" will update your code to match what you have saved on github!

Now that we're ready to save our changes, take a look at the bottom left hand corner of your screen. You should see a blue "Commit to `your branch`" button. Before we click that, feel free to add a description or add a co-author to your commit!

## Pushing Commits on Desktop
After you're done working and ready to back your changes up to GitHub, hit that bright blue "Push origin" button and watch the magic.
